Introduction
============

Welcome to BeamScheme. This software will assist you in extracting 1D profiles from 2D datasets and calculating various parameters on the profiles. BeamScheme can open various image and 2D array file formats such as SNC MapCheck, PTW 720, IBA Matrix and StarTrack, XiO, jpg, etc. Parameters such as field size, field centre, penumbra, flatness and symmetry are calculated. Profiles can be taken at any angle, offset or thickness. Profiles can be exported to a text file for further processing. Results can be printed or exported to PDF. BeamScheme is not intended to replace the commercial software available with 2D arrays, but to complement it.



This manual assumes that you are familiar with using your operating system.
If you are not then please consult the appropriate documentation and on-line
help. BeamScheme can run on a variety of operating systems and while a thorough
knowledge of your specific system is not necessary some basic knowledge such
as running files will be an advantage.
