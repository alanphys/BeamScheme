Inflection Point Field Centre
=============================

The field centre (*FC*) is defined as the distance in cm from the centre of the detector to the centre of the field and is calculated as the half the difference between the distance from the profile centre to the right and left :ref:`Inflection Point Field Edge`:

.. math:: FC = \cfrac {d(RE) + d(LE)} {2}

Where *d(RE)* and *d(LE)* are the linear distances from the profile centre to the right and left field edges respectively.

|Note| The profile must be centered on the origin as defined by the array or imaging modality for best results.
