Field Size
==========

The field size (*FS*) is defined as the distance from the left field edge to the right field edge:

.. math:: FS = d(RE) - d(LE)

Where *d(RE)* and *d(LE)* the linear distances from the profile centre to the right and left field edges respectively. 

|Note| Noisy data can lead to a inaccurate field size being reported.

|Note| The right and left field edges are affected by the set window levels.
