20% left inflection point distance
==================================

The tradional parameters for defining the penumbra do not work for FFF beams. The closest comparable value for FFF beams to the 20% dose level distance for WFF beams is to take the distance of 0.4 x the dose value of the inflection point. For WFF beams this corresponds to the 20% dose level (50% x 0.4 = 20%).
  
This is the distance from the origin as determined by the array or imaging modality to the dose level corresponding to 0.4 x the dose at the inflection point on the left side of the profile.

Variable name: IL20
