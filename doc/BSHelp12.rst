Errors and trouble shooting
===========================

BeamScheme has sophisticated error checking and detection. Error messages and warnings
are displayed in the Status Bar. During the operation of
the program you may encounter a variety of warning and error messages. There
are three types of messages.

#) Informational: These give details of the programs working. These messages 
   have a grey background. No action is required they are for information only. For 
   example the startup message "BeamScheme initialised correctly'.
#) Actional: The program is requiring some kind of response from you. These messages
   have a yellow background. For example "Click Point A"
#) Error: The program has detected an error condition. These messages are displayed
   with a red background. Some errors will not allow you to continue until the 
   error has been corrected. In this case the area or areas with the error will
   be highlighted in red.


Some common error messages and their causes are discussed below:
