Field Centre
============

The field centre (*FC*) is defined as the half the difference between the distance from the profile centre to the right and left field edges:

.. math:: FC = \cfrac {d(RE) + d(LE)} {2}

Where *d(RE)* and *d(LE)* are the linear distances from the profile centre to the right and left field edges respectively.
