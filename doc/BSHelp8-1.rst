The Profile Panes
=================

The profile pane displays the pixel, dose, fluence or detector values under the corresponding profile on the image pane. The profile pane can be maximised in the application window by clicking the maximise button |max|. Individual profile values can be read by hovering the mouse cursor over the section of profile in question. The profile pane can be returned to its original state by clicking the minimise button |min|.

The profiles are altered by the Offset, Width and Angle spin boxes.
