System Requirements
===================

BeamScheme can run on a variety of platforms and operating systems. Currently EPS is
compiled for:

- Windows XP or higher

- Fedora 26 running KDE

The program needs approximately 5 MB of disk space to install. A 19" monitor or 
larger is not essential but will make viewing easier. BeamScheme should not be viewed 
at a resolution of less than 1280x1024. Other linux versions such as GTK based may be
available on request.
