Inflection point left slope
===========================

The slope of the Hill function at the inflection point provides a good indication of the width of the penumbra. This is the slope of the penumbra on the left side of the profile.

Negative axis increments are converted to positive. The axis sign is then applied to the results.

Variable name: LSlope

|Note| If the penumbra straddles the origin the non-linear regression will fail.
