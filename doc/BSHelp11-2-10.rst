Dose Difference
===============

The flatness dose difference parameter is the normalised difference between the maximum and minimum profile values taken over 80% of the field size:

.. math:: 100 \cdot \cfrac {max-min} {max + min}
   
Where *max* and *min* are the profile maximum and minimum respectively.

|Note| The *max* and *min* may be affected by the set window levels.
