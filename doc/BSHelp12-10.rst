Could not evaluate expression
-----------------------------

The protocol expression you have just entered contains a mistake. Expressions should not contain spaces or any special characters other than the standard pascal arithmetic operators.

The parser also may not have recognised the name of a function or variable you have used. Please check that the functions are valid pascal functions and that the variable names correspond to the defined variables.
