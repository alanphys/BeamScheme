Technical Assistance
====================

There are, of course, no bugs in the software. However, it may happen that
the software does not behave in a manner you expect or generates results that
you think are wrong. If so, we would like to know about it. Likewise, if you
feel BeamScheme should be doing something that it isn't, please tell us.
