Mean Value
==========

The mean value dose parameter is the normalised average between the maximum and minimum profile values taken over 80% of the field size:

.. math:: \cfrac {100} {cax} \cdot \cfrac {max + min} {2}
   
Where *max* and *min* are the profile maximum and minimum respectively and *cax* is the profile centre value.

|Note| The *max*, *min* and *cax* may be affected by the set window levels.
