50% right inflection point distance
===================================

The inflection point is not necessarily at the 50% dose level for WFF beams. To provide a comparative value for WFF beams the distance to the 50% dose level of the Hill function is provided.
  
This is the distance from the origin as determined by the array or imaging modality to the dose level corresponding to 0.5 x the difference between the sigmoid high level and the sigmoid low level on the right side of the profile.

Variable name: IR50
