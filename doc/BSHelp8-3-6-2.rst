Save protocol
=============

When in editing mode opens the save dialog to save the protocol. It is highly recommended that you do not save over existing protocols. Instead give the changed protocol a unique name. Protocols saved in other directories will not be identified by the program. If you cancel the dialog you will return to the editing mode.

|Note| Do not save over a predefined protocol.

|Note| Do not save the protocol in any other directory.
