Point Difference
================

The point difference (also called maximum variation) is the maximum absolute difference between the left and right profile values at the same distance from the profile or detector centre:

.. math:: 100 \cdot \cfrac {P(dL) - P(dR)} {cax}
   
for *dR* = -*dL* from 0 to 80% of the field size

|Note| The point difference symmetry may be affected by the field centre. If the field is slightly offset you can use the "Centre field" tool |CentreField| to correct any offset.
