80% left inflection point distance
===================================

The tradional parameters for defining the penumbra do not work for FFF beams. The closest comparable value for FFF beams to the 80% dose level distance for WFF beams is to take the distance of 1.6 x the dose value of the inflection point. For WFF beams this corresponds to the 80% dose level (50% x 1.6 = 80%).
  
This is the distance from the origin as determined by the array or imaging modality to the dose level corresponding to 1.6 x the dose at the inflection point on the left side of the profile.

Variable name: IL80
