Inflection Point Field Size
===========================

The field size (*FS*) is defined as the distance from the left :ref:`Inflection Point Field Edge` to the right :ref:`Inflection Point Field Edge`:

.. math:: FS = d(RE) - d(LE)

Where *d(RE)* and *d(LE)* the linear distances from the profile centre to the right and left field edges respectively. 

|Note| The profile must be centered on the origin as defined by the array or imaging modality for best results.
