Interpolated Parameters
=======================

These parameters are the distances from the central axis as defined by the array or imaging modality for a certain dose level and form the base parameters of the traditional definitions of field size and centre. These dose levels usually fall between two measured points. In order to improve accuracy, particularly for 2D arrays where the measurements are relatively sparse, the distance of the dose level is interpolated by linear interpolation from the adjacent data points.
