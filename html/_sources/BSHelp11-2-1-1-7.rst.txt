Area Symmetry
=============

The area symmetry is the normalised difference between the right and left areas under the profile up to the :ref:`field edges <Field Edge>`:

.. math:: 100 \cdot \cfrac {RA-LA} {RA + LA}
   
Where *RA* and *LA* are the area under the profile from the profile or detector centre to the right and left :ref:`Field Edge` respectively.

|Note| The area symmetry is affected by the field centre. If the field is slightly offset you can use the "Centre field" tool |CentreField| to correct any offset.

|Note| Some programs use a mulitplicative factor of 200.
