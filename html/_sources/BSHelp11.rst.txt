Parameters
==========

All parameters are calculated relative to the central axis (CAX) value unless otherwise specified. The CAX is defined as half the profile or detector width or height. Where there is an even number of detectors or pixels and these straddle the CAX the average of the two detectors or pixels is taken.

The parameters, except where otherwise specified, are calculated on the in field area. This area was previously defined as the flattened area, but this definition no longer holds for FFF beams. BeamScheme defines the in field area as 80% of the calculated field size. 

|Note| Most commercial programs use the nominal field size to calculate the in field area.

Parameters are calculated by combining base parameters in an arithmetic expression. The following parameters are available:
