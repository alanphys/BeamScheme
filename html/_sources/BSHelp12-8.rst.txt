No protocol definition files found. Please create a file
--------------------------------------------------------

You must have at least one protocol definition file available either in the 'Protocol' subdirectory of the executable (program) directory, or in the user data directory. On installation BeamScheme will copy a number of default protocols into the 'BeamScheme' subdirectory of the user configuration directory. Any new protocol is automatically saved in the the 'BeamScheme' subdirectory of the user configuration directory.

Check that you have not accidentally deleted the protocols. If you have you will have to reinstall BeamScheme.
