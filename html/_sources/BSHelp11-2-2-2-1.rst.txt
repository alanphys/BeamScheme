Inflection Point Penumbra 80%-20%
=================================

The tradional parameters for defining the penumbra do not work for FFF beams. The 80%-20% penumbra based on the inflection point is calculated as the distance between the :ref:`80% left inflection point distance` to the :ref:`20% left inflection point distance` for the left penumbra and similarly for the right penumbra.

|Note| The profile must be centered on the origin as defined by the array or imaging modality for best results.
