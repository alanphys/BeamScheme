Left inflection point
=====================

This is the inflection point on the left side of the profile as determined by non-linear regression on a Hill function:

Negative axis increments are converted to positive. The axis sign is then applied to the results.

Variable name: LInf

|Note| If the penumbra straddles the origin the non-linear regression will fail.
