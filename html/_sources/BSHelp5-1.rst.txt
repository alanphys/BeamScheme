Uninstalling previous versions
==============================

It is no longer necessary to uninstall previous versions of BeamScheme before 
installing a new version. Please note that the installation utility will not
backup any image or 2D array files in the directory. You will need to do this
yourself. If, for any reason, you still want to uninstall the program 
please follow the instructions below:
