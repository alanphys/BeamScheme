Using BeamScheme
================


Using BeamScheme is simple. There are two profiles, a horizontal or X profile and a vertical or Y profile. The X profile is displayed in the top right quadrant or pane of the screen. The Y profile is displayed in the bottom left quadrant. The result are displayed in the bottom right quadrant. The opened image, fluence or 2D array file is displayed in the top left quadrant. The status bar at the bottom of the screen communicates error messages and warnings. Profiles and results are calculated automatically when a profile is changed or a file is opened.
