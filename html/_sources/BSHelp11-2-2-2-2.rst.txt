Penumbra Slope
==============

The tradional parameters for defining the penumbra do not work for FFF beams. The slope of the Hill function at the inflection point provides a good indication of the width of the penumbra. The :ref:`Inflection point left slope` and :ref:`Inflection point right slope` are given.

|Note| The profile must be centered on the origin as defined by the array or imaging modality for best results.
