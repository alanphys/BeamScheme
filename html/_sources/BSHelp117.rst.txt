Area Symmetry
=============

The area symmetry is the normalised difference between the right and left areas under the profile up to the field edges:

.. math:: \cfrac {RA-LA} {RA + LA} * 100
   
Where *RA* and *LA* are the area under the profile from the profile or detector centre to the right and left field edges respectively.

|Note| The area symmetry is affected by the field centre. If the field is slightly offset you can use the "Centre field" tool |CentreField| to correct any offset.
