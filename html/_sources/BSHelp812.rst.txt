   pair: Profile; Width

Width
=====

Widens the profile symmetrically around the profile centre. Values can be increased or decreased by using the up and down arrows respectively in the spin box. Values can be entered by keyboard. Default value is 1. This means the value will always be odd and will increment by 2. Only positive values are allowed. If an even value is entered via the keyboard the profile width will be the next lowest odd value.
