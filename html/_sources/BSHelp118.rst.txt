Ratio Symmetry
==============

Ratio symmetry is the maximum ratio between the left and right profile values at the same distance from the profile or detector centre:

.. math:: max(\cfrac {P(dL)} {P(dR)} , \cfrac {P(dR)} {P(dL)} )
   
for *dR* = -*dL* from 0 to 80% of the field size

|Note| The ratio symmetry is affected by the field centre. If the field is slightly offset you can use the "Centre field" tool |CentreField| to correct any offset.
