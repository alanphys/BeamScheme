  This component is based on the original parser Pars7 developed by Renate Schaaf (schaaf@math.usu.edu). Pars7 was fast indeed, but somehow restricted to scientific purposes due to the limited number of predefined variables. Unfortunately, Pars7 also was quite stack hungry and had several elusive bugs while deallocating expression tree.

  Now dressed as a component, TParser has low stack demands even in its 16 bit version, accepts practically an unlimited number of variables, and several parts of the builder code were entirely rewritten for the sake of clarity.

  I would greatly appreciate suggestions, bug reports, any feed-back that might contribute to further improve TParser's speed and functionality.
